# Liri - a node.js app

Welcome to Liri, the node.js based language interpretation and recognition interface. Liri runs on your command line and is your companion to help find music, concerts and movies.

## Getting started

It's easy as `npm i`. As long as you have node installed, just download the dependencies included in the package.json.

### APIs used

Liri utilizes data from the follwing APIs

* [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
* [Bandsintown](https://manager.bandsintown.com/support/bandsintown-api)
* [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/)


## Running Liri in node

Liri is used wherever you use node. In your bash/terminal of choice, run `liri.js` and the command line interface will prompt you with your choices. You can search Bandsintown to get tour dates of your favorite artist, Spotify for info on your latest jam, or end that argument with Laura over what year the orinial Star Wars came out.
